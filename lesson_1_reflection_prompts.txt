How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me to see the lines added and removed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	It helps to revert back to the older version very easily.
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It provides the flexibility to the user to choose the version he/she would like to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To compare multiple files simultaneously.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log 
	git log --stat
	git diff <commitid1> <commitid2>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Using version control has provides me flexibility as well as ease for making changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Some college project.
